### Introduction ###
As per the <a href="http://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/249151504766545101/pdf/119208-BRI-PUBLIC-Brief-Fraud-in-Mobile-Financial-Services-April-2017.pdf" target="_blank">World Bank report</a>, the rise of mobile financial services (MFS) is one of the most important contributors towards the financial inclusion in the emerging markets. While it has facilitated cheap and reliable financial services to formerly unbanked population segment. With the growing use of these services, there is a growth in the financial frauds too.

Financial frauds detection is an important research field and that's why the synethic data based in the aggregate real data was simulated by PaySim. The current dataset is provided by the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/ntnu-testimon/paysim1" target="_blank">PaySim Data research team at Kaggle</a> that resembles the normal operation of transactions and injects malicious behaviour to later evaluate the performance of fraud detection methods.
