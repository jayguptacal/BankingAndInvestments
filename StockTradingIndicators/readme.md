The data sometimes may not load properly in the new window, so please reload it until it shows properly.

Here is a full list of activities performed in this notebook:

- **Import of Stock Data from Yahoo Finance** - Using the pandas datareader and Yahoo Finance, data for the SPY was loaded for the period from "2020-01-01" to "2021-04-01"


- **Import of required packages and libraries** - Required packages and libraries for doing the analysis were imported as the analysis is based on using the Open Source libraries and packages


- **Calculation of Lagging Indicators** - Following lagging indicators were calculated:
    - Simple Moving Averages (SMA)
    - Exponential Moving Averages (EMA)
    - Bollinger Bands (BB)
    - Parabolic Stop and Reverse (SAR)
    
    
- **Calculation of Leading Indicators** - Following leading indicators were calculated:
    - Average Directional Movement Index (ADX)
    - Commodity Channel Index (CCI)
    - Momentum Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD)
    - Rate of Change (ROC)
    - Relative Strength Indicator (RSI)
    - Stochastic Oscillator (STO)
    - Williams %R
    
    
- **Import of Tesla (TSLA) stock data from Yahoo Finance** - Using the pandas datareader and Yahoo Finance, data for the TSLA was loaded for the period from "2020-01-01" to "2021-04-01"


- **Trading Decision for TSLA Symbol** - Following technical indicators were used to decide the 'Buy' or 'Sell' or 'Do Nothing' signal for the Tesla stock:
    - Simple Moving Averages (SMA) and Exponential Moving Averages (EMA)
    - Bollinger Bands (BB) and Parabolic Stop and Reverse (SAR)
    - Momentum Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) and Relative Strength Indicator (RSI)
    
    
The purpose of this project is to gain the experience in dealing with the stock market data which is normally very data-heavy and complicated and use this knowledge to build a stock trading dashboard in future.
