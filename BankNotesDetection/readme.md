## Introduction
<p>This dataset was developed using genuine and fake bank notes which were scanned and wavelet transformation was performed on the images. During this process, following features were collected:</p>

- Variance of wavelet transformation
- Skewness of wavelet transformation
- Curtosis of wavelet transformation
- Entropy of image

If you are wondering, what is wavelet transformation?

As per Science Direct (https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/wavelet-transforms), wavelets are a general way to analyze multi-dimensional images. This is very useful for image compression and removing noise. If you are looking for more information, you can check out at the Wikipedia at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_wavelet_transform.

**The goal of this project is to use Random Forest Classifier, a supervised machine learning algorithm to predict genuine vs fake bank notes.**
