## Introduction
<p>TThe data is based on a number of fictitious bank transfers done by a person named Edward of Nigeria who is involved in money laundering activities as per the law authorities. He has been transferring money via a Russian bank and other means for which suspected transaction reports (STR's) are provided and the imported dataset is based on it. The money is being sent to a beneficiary named as Mr. N here.</p>

<p>The goals of this project are to answer the following questions: </p>

- What is the total inflow to MR N for the period given in the data?
- How much money was sent to MR N from Edward?
- Are there other people sending money to MR N and from which Jurisdictions?
- How many jurisdictions money is being sent from?
- Which local bank received the most funds on behalf of MR N?
- What is the location of the banks that are beneficiaries of funds on behalf of MR N?

## Transform and Protect Data

This step is extremely important as like any other investigation, it is important to ensure that data provided is fully kept in the original form and it is recommended always to work on the data after making a copy. This will provide a baseline point for any future requirements during the investigations.

Here are the main steps:

- Make a duplicate copy of the file
- Protect the original file and keep it in a secured environment
- Maintain the chain of custody of evidence
- For the purpose of this exercise, the original data is saved in the tab as 'originalData' and make antoher tab with the original data and save it as 'workingData'.
- Make sure to protect the 'originalData' tab spreadsheet with a password so that nobody can change it.
